# Election-Analysis

## Challenge Objective:
This challenge had me organize thousands of rows of data from an election taking place across the counties of Jefferson, Denver and Arapahoe. The module showed me how to retrieve data on the votes for the candidates, but the challenge itself required I use similar functions in python to retrieve the same data for each county. Overall, the finished product can be summed up here:

Denver county contains the largest share of voters at 306,055 (83%) and the winner (by a landslide) was Diana DeGette with 272,892 votes (74%). 

## Overview of Election Audit

The purpose of this election analysis audit is well defined. (3 pt)
For this challenge, I found the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, and the county with the highest turnout. I utilized "for loops" and conditional statements with membership and logical operators to find these results. The findings were printed to a text file, which is included in this report (election_reslts.txt). 

## Election Audit Results

There is a bulleted list where each election outcome is addressed. (7 pt)


## Election Audit Summary

There is a statement to the election commission that explores how this script can be used for any election, with two examples for modifying the script. (4 pt)
